      An \R{} object.  Currently there are methods for
          numeric/logical vectors and \link[=Dates]{date},
          \link{date-time} and \link{time interval} objects.  Complex vectors
          are allowed for \code{trim = 0}, only.

  trim:
    original: "the fraction (0 to 0.5) of observations to be\n    trimmed from each
      end of \\code{x} before the mean is computed.\n    Values of trim outside that
      range are taken as the nearest endpoint.\n  "

      a logical evaluating to \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}
          indicating whether \code{NA} values should be stripped before the
          computation proceeds.

      If \code{trim} is zero (the default), the arithmetic mean of the
      values in \code{x} is computed, as a numeric or complex vector of
      length one.  If \code{x} is not logical (coerced to numeric), numeric
      (including integer) or complex, \code{NA_real_} is returned, with a warning.

      If \code{trim} is non-zero, a symmetrically trimmed mean is computed
      with a fraction of \code{trim} observations deleted from each end
      before the mean is computed.
